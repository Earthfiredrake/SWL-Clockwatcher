<!-- The attributes "de", and "fr" can be used for translations of each string, if needed -->

<!-- Category and string tag names are referenced from the mod, and should not be changed -->
<!-- Strings themselves should be compatible with boost::format for inserting further data -->
<!-- See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/format/doc/format.html#syntax for details (TSW likely uses earlier version, unsure which)-->
